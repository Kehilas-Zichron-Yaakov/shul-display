In honor of our Rabbi. May he teach us true ahavath and yirath Hashem and ahavath Yisrael to remove any and all sinath hinam from our hearts in this month of Av, when such hatred took our Temple from us and destroyed Yerushalayim. In doing so, may we hold our shul sacred by refraining from needless conversation so we may be worthy to see the Messiah in our days. Dedicated by the Huerta Family
