Maos Chittim Campaign

With Pesach approaching, the shul will be collecting Maos Chittim for members of our community. 

Money will be distributed directly by the Rov. Checks can be delivered to myself and should be made payable to Kehilas Zichron Yaakov. Payments can also be made via Zelle to kehilaszichronyaakov@gmail.com or online at: https://pay.banquest.com/kzy/

With your generous contributions, the hope is to collect the necessary funds that will assist the families of our community in purchasing Matzah and other items in order to allow everyone to enjoy a beautiful and meaningful Yom Tov.
