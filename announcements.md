MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD

Dear Members,

As we all know, a lot has happened over the past year. We went from our annual Yeshivas Mordechai Hatzadik last Purim straight into the Covid shutdown, then to our Tent Shul, and finally to our wonderful new Shul. This accomplishment was made possible through your commitment, dedication, and generosity. We are fortunate to be part of a community that recognizes and appreciates the importance of a true makom torah vâ€™tefillah.

Along with our community growth, our annual budget has increased to $95,000. This includes all shul operating expenses (mortgage, insurance, utilities, salary, cleaning, landscaping, etc.). We expect to raise approximately $77,000 this year from membership dues, bedek habayis, ner lamaor, and aliyos/kibbudim etc. This leaves us with an $18,000 deficit.

To cover the increased operating expenses, we will be increasing the annual membership fee as follows:

2021: $800
2022: $1,000

We understand that some members might not be in a position to pay the increased amount.  As always, please reach out to Chesky Kranczer if this applies to you.

We want to extend a big thank you to all who signed the Kedushas Bais Haknesses poster. We will be using the program funds for the Phase II legal and architectural costs.

As always, please feel free to reach out to any board member with any questions, concerns or ideas.

The Board of Directors
