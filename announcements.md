**Week of Parshas Terumah**

**MAZAL TOV** to Chesky & Zahava Roth on the birth of a baby girl!

**Shul Parking** - As many of you are aware the parking in front of the shul and on Durante Ct  has become untenable. This letter was delivered today and frankly was expected. This not only puts phase II in great jeopardy but puts our existing shul in great danger of being shut down. We all understand that parking is essential but we would like to put the following in place effective immediately. This will stay in place at least for the immediate future until a more comprehensive plan is put in place.   • NO PARKING ON DURANTE CT   • those that live in close proximity to Durante should make every effort to walk  • if parking is necessary, it should be on one side of Landau Ln in front of 21, 23 & 25 leaving ample space for homeowners to get into their driveways  • try carpooling to Shul  

**Matanos L'evyonin** - The shul will be offering an opportunity to give Matanos L'evyonin to be distributed locally on Purim through the shul. 

Checks can be delivered to Chesky Kranczer or the Rov and should be made payable to Kehilas Zichron Yaakov. Payments can also be made via Zelle to kehilaszichronyaakov@gmail.com OR by following this link:  https://pay.banquest.com/kzy/

**Yarzeit Board** - A yarzeit board has been sponsored for the shul. We will be selling individual plaques for $360. If you would like to sponsor a yarzeit plaque, please contact Pinchas Nussbaum.
